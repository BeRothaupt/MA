\chapter*{Acknowledgement}
I would like to thank Stefan Notter (M.Sc.) for making it possible for me to write my master's thesis at iFR. As my supervisor, he always had time to answer my questions patiently and came up with helpful ideas. Working on this thesis with him was a great experience. My gratitude also goes to Dr. rer. nat. Werner Grimm for being my examiner.
